# Realtime Climate Analysis Pipeline

## Overview
This repository contains a powerful realtime climate analysis pipeline leveraging various AWS services and Snowflake, along with Power BI for insightful visualizations. The pipeline is designed to ingest data from a weather API, store it in Dynamo DB, process it through AWS Lambda functions, store it in S3, and finally load it into Snowflake for further analysis. Python scripts are utilized for carrying out advanced analytics such as linear regression on the collected data.

## Features
- **Data Ingestion:** Utilizes AWS Lambda functions to ingest data from the Climate API into Dynamo DB.
- **Data Storage:** Dynamo DB is used as the primary data storage, with Dynamo DB streams used to trigger the ingestion of data into S3.
